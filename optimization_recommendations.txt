# Module Optimization Recommendations
# Generated by First Principles Analysis

1. Type: THRESHOLD
   Target: Low bitrate protection
   Action: Reduce frequency_analyzer, texture_noise_detector weights for bitrate < 2 Mbps
   Reason: Low bitrate videos naturally have compression artifacts

2. Type: MODULE_PARAM
   Target: frequency_analyzer
   Action: Reduce sensitivity or weight by 13%
   Reason: Score 11.8 points higher in false positives

3. Type: MODULE_PARAM
   Target: model_fingerprint_detector
   Action: Reduce sensitivity or weight by 50%
   Reason: Score 57.1 points higher in false positives

4. Type: MODULE_PARAM
   Target: heartbeat_detector
   Action: Reduce sensitivity or weight by 7%
   Reason: Score 3.5 points higher in false positives

5. Type: MODULE_PARAM
   Target: sensor_noise_authenticator
   Action: Reduce sensitivity or weight by 2%
   Reason: Score 1.7 points higher in false positives

6. Type: MODULE_PARAM
   Target: physics_violation_detector
   Action: Reduce sensitivity or weight by -10%
   Reason: Score -7.0 points higher in false positives

7. Type: THRESHOLD
   Target: Global thresholds
   Action: Consider adjusting SAFE/GRAY/KILL thresholds based on distribution
   Reason: Current accuracy 7.1% below target 90%
